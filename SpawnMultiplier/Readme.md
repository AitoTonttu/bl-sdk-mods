## Changelog

### Spawn Multiplier v1.3
Prevented multiplying spawn counts for some non-enemy actors, which could cause softlocks in some cases (e.g. Burrows' generators).

### Spawn Multiplier v1.2
Fixed that spawn limit changes would not be reapplied on map change, they'd always revert to standard.    
Fixed some more instances where spawn counts would round down to 0.

### Spawn Multiplier v1.1
Fixed that changing the multiplier could occasionally round spawn counts down to 0.    
Fixed that disabling the mod would not revert spawn counts.

### Spawn Multiplier v1.0
Inital Release
