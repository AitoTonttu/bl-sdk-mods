## bl-sdk-mods
To use these mods install the Borderlands [PythonSDK](https://github.com/bl-sdk/PythonSDK), then copy the whole folder into the SDK's "Mods" folder.

Only complete mods are listed below.

### ItemLevelUncapper
This mod is useless by itself, it should be used alongside the hexedit to increase the player level cap.    
Fixes the level cap of most items so that they continue spawning past level 100.    
Note that items past level 127 will overflow upon save-quit, and that Gibbed's Save Editor won't let you create items past 127, so past that point you'll have to pick up everything you use within the same session.    
Also note that there may still be various other issues with an increased level cap, this only fixes that most items stopped spawning.

Compatible with both BL2 and TPS.

### Onezerker
Ever felt gunzerking with two different guns was too complicated? No? Well too bad. Makes you gunzerk with two copies of the same gun instead of two different ones.    
Thanks to FromDarkHell for finding the object which lets you gunzerk with only one equipped gun.

Only compatible with BL2 (obviously).
