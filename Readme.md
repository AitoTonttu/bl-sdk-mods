## bl-sdk-mods
To use these mods:
1. Install the Borderlands [PythonSDK](https://github.com/bl-sdk/PythonSDK)
2. Open the SDK Mods folder - launch the game, go into the new `Mods` menu, make sure you've got the `General` mod selected, and then press `O`
3. Download one of the mod zip files and open it
4. Copy the folder from inside the zip into the SDK Mods folder you just opened

If a folder doesn't have a zip file then the mod inside is likely incomplete. If you know what you're doing you can attempt to install it manually, but it may well have issues.    
Only complete mods are listed below.

### ItemLevelUncapper
This mod is useless by itself, it should be used alongside the hexedit to increase the player level cap.    
Fixes the level cap of most items so that they continue spawning past level 100.    
Note that items past level 127 will overflow upon save-quit, and that Gibbed's Save Editor won't let you create items past 127, so past that point you'll have to pick up everything you use within the same session.    
Also note that there may still be various other issues with an increased level cap, this only fixes that most items stopped spawning.

Compatible with both BL2 and TPS.

### Onezerker
Ever felt gunzerking with two different guns was too complicated? No? Well too bad. Makes you gunzerk with two copies of the same gun instead of two different ones.    
Thanks to FromDarkHell for finding the object which lets you gunzerk with only one equipped gun.

Only compatible with BL2 (obviously).

### Python Part Notifier
Shows the parts making up all of your items and weapons on their cards. Yes this even includes Grenades, COMs, and Relics/Oz Kits. Has full mod support, so if a mod adds extra parts to a weapon or changes a part's mesh it will properly update. Unique part support is limited, they may just have the same name as the base part with the same mesh.

What exactly is shown on the card is very customizable through the options menu. Don't care about a part slot? You can turn it off. Running out of space with all the parts you want to show? You can remove the original description. Or playing Randomizer and want to know what weapons each part comes from? Why not use detailed part names. All these options save between sessions, so you only have to set them up once.

Note that there are thousands of parts, so it's not impossible that the mod gets something wrong, don't be afraid to double check. If you do find an issue please report it alongside a gibbed code for the item.

Compatible with both BL2 and TPS.

### Scaling Adjuster
A simple tool that adds an option to change the game's base scaling value. Your settings are saved between sessions    
Note that you may have to save quit for values to update.

Compatible with both BL2 and TPS.
