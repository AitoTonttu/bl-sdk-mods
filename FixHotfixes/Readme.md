# Fix Hotfixes

**NOTE:** This mod is no longer needed, BLCMM has updated to point hotfix commands at the new object.

Allows you to use "online" text mod hotfixes, by adding dummy objects to reorder SHiFT services.

Note that this solution is *not* stable, and will likely break if Gearbox reorders services again.

## Changelog

### Fix Hotfixes v1.0
Inital Release.
