### User Feedback
Simple helper file for showing feedback to your users. Adds functions to let you show three types of messages:

1. Small messages on the left of the screen, like those used for respawn cost messages.
2. Messages in the middle of the screen that pause the game, like those used for the special edition item message on new characters.
3. Dialog boxes with multiple options to choose from, like those used to select playthrough or to confirm quitting.
